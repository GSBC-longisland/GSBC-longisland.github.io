Hi, I'm Rick. I've built a coffee trailer that I use to serve coffee and other beverages* at Bayport Flower Houses on Montauk Highway. 

GSBC is something I'm figuring out as I go. The big motivation for starting this business has been to learn by doing. One of the things I'm learning is what shape I want GSBC to take, although I struggle to put it into words. In simplest terms: I want to serve excellent coffee close to home. Simpler: Quality and Community. 

In my first month of operations, Bayport Flower Houses has been a fantastic place for Great South Bay Coffee to grow. People are able to walk to my trailer from their home. People want to tell their friends about my coffee. The nursery is already a beautiful place to drink a coffee and it's a family business that's been part of the community for almost a century already. Bayport has been incredibly welcoming! And they're just down the road from my home in Patchogue!

One thing (among many) that GSBC is, is an attempt to go small. We see so many businesses that try to scale up to the largest possible size, and in doing so they have to standardize out what delighted their customers in the first place. Great South Bay Coffee is a specific thing in a specific place. It's for neighbors, not algorithms. I feel best when I'm on the stretch of Montauk Highway between Oakdale and Moriches, so the literal Great South Bay is a natural place for me to focus on. 

There are people I care about all over the world. But my *neighbors* live by the Great South Bay. And they're who I'm making coffee for.

*My menu is evolving, but I think a coffee place should also have non-coffee beverages. My trailer is small, so there's only so much I can do, but I try to cover a lot of ground: caffienated and non-caffienated, warm and cold, comforting and refreshing.
