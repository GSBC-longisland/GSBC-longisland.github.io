## End of year update

I'll be closed for the holidays, but plan to keep running through the winter once I'm back and restocked. Hours will probably be a bit shorter (probably 10-2ish), but I expect to continue operating Thursdays, Fridays, and Sundays. Once the farmer's market[^1] finishes up for the season I will be back to operating on Saturdays as well.

[^1]: The farmer's market is a different entity than the Flower Houses. I tried to get on the roster this year but they already had a coffee vendor and were not interested in having a second, even if I ran a limited menu (e.g. matcha, hot chocolate, etc.). I'm looking into alternatives for next season, but this time around I'm just going to eat the loss. I might even try actually resting on Saturdays.
