Here are two underrated facts I wish more people appreciated:

1. Knowledge exists in and is inextricable from a massive network. Nothing worth knowing can be known without first knowing something else.
2. Knowledge compounds. As you unlock more nodes in that network, you gain access to exponentially more knowledge. 

A lot of what I do in the trailer is pretty simple, but that's because it's built on a preexisting network of knowledge and experience.
The secret to making a good espresso shot is to start by making 100 espresso shots. 
It also helps to have taken a couple chemistry classes in the days before iPhones. And to have spent some time baking bread. 
It also turns out (despite any reasonable predictions) a photography class at community college. 

This page is to keep and share some of the sources of knowledge on the Internet that feel relevant to my work in and on the trailer.
This is a living list that will grow and change over time.
