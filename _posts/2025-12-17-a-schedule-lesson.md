This week I tried opening at 8:30 on Monday and Wednesday. And both mornings I was out the door before my wife had even woken up. 

I want GSBC to be two things simultaneously: a friendly, approachable, neighborhood place, *and* a destination worth going out of your way for.
In the neighborhood where I'm operating, that means people mostly want to stop by during mid-to-late morning. There should be people looking for an earlier coffee, but it's going
to take some special effort to get them on board. 
In the mean time, 10am is a perfectly reasonable opening time.

This is a big thing for me. I've got an 80-year-old woman's circadian rhythm. I wake up before dawn (usually because of my cat, Ted, who gets lonely around 5am) and I want a coffee right away.
But I guess that's just me.
