Hello, Internet! 

I'm hoping that this website will be an easy way to for me to share details about my coffee trailer 
without relying too much on Silicon Valley or their intrusive cookies and trackers and everything else.

But it's going to take a bit of time to sort it out. As of right now (the first day it's online), it's 
a bit simple. But that's fine. It's just a placeholder for now. But (hopefully) it'll be worth checking 
back to see... I don't know what.
