### January hours 

Happy New Year!

I'm currently undergoing some plumbing issues, but plan to open up **Monday, January 12** from 10-1. 

Once everything is back on line, cleaned, and refreshed, the plan is to be open **every Thursday, Friday, and Sunday** from 10-3 for the rest of January (and probably a lot of February as well).

|  | | open | close |
|-----|------|-------|-----|
| Monday | Jan 12 & 19 | 10am | 1pm |
| Tuesday | | closed | closed |
| Wednesday | | closed | closed |
| Thursday | | 10am | 3pm |
| Friday | | 10am | 3pm |
| Saturday | | closed | closed |
| Sunday | | 10am | 3pm |
