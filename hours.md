### September hours

|  | open | close |
|-----|------|-------|
| Thursday | 8am | 2pm |
| Friday | 8am | 3pm |
| Saturday | 8am | 3pm |
| Sunday | 9am | 3pm |

These are my default hours as of September 2025. I'm shifting Saturday hours back an hour 
to accomodate the fall classes at [Bayport Flower Houses](https://www.bayportflower.com/events/).
I'm going to try the same on Fridays as an experiment. I suspect there are more people who want
something to drink Friday afternoon than Friday morning. 

But I want to be open when you want me to be open, so tell me about it the next time you stop by. 
I can't be open all the time (I'm just one person), but if enough people want me to shift things around, 
I'd rather know what you want.
