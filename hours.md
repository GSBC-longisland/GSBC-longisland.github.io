### Winter hours

These hours are pretty aspirational (I'm writing this update after a big snow storm and leading up to a cold weather advisory), but this is what I _hope_ my hours will look like when the cold weather lets off.

|  | | open | close |
|-----|------|-------|-----|
| Monday |  | 12pm | 3pm |
| Tuesday | | closed | closed |
| Wednesday | | closed | closed |
| Thursday | | 10am | 3pm |
| Friday | | 10am | 3pm |
| Saturday | | 2pm | 4pm |
| Sunday | | 10am | 3pm |

But for **this week** I'll be closed until at least Groundhog Day. And as a general rule, I'll probably be closed on days when the high is below 25 degrees. As usual, check Instagram for the latest updates.
