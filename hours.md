### Week off to recover
I tweaked my back pretty badly at the end of January which has put me out of commission. But I plan to open back up Thursday February 12th.

### Winter hours

These hours are pretty aspirational (I'm writing this update after a big snow storm and leading up to a cold weather advisory), but this is what I _hope_ my hours will look like when the cold weather lets off. 

If the weather forecast looks bad (windy, cold, etc.) check my Instagram account for updates.
